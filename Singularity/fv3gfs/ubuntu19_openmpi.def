%help
    This Singularity definition contains build instructions for the GFDL Finite Volume
    Cubed Sphere (FV3) general atmospheric circulation model and its required libraries.

    The model is built with MPI distributed parallelization only using OpenMPI built with
    the GNU compiler suite.

    Some useful commands are:

    sudo singularity build <mysingularity_name>.sif ubuntu_openmpi4.XX.def
    This command builds an immutable Singularity container in the new Singularity Image Format (SIF)

    singularity run <mysingularity_name>.sif bash
    Opens a BASH terminal in the Singularity container environment.  Great for checking if
    built libraries and environment settings are properly done.  Do not use this command to
    run FV3 as you will not be running in parallel.

    mpirun -np <# of MPI ranks> singularity run <mysingularity_name>.sif /myapps/FV3/fv3.exe
    Proper command to run your Singularity container with MPI parallelization enabled.  The host
    MPI library will override the MPI calls built inside the container.
